Wordpress is super nice for what it does but it always felt like overkill to need a database and all the infrastructure that goes along with it.

Instead this new site is going to leverage just static content with no database. We may add comments using something like Disqus but nothing in the works just yet.

Should be an adventure since I'm rolling my own engine and leveraging Markdown for the writing.
